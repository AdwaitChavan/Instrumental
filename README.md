**Instrumental** is an Android mobile application project providing musicians a platform to borrow & lend instruments. The lender side provides functionalities to upload your own instruments with their specifications and rental rate. The borrower side emphasizes exploring a collection of instruments uploaded by various users. The borrower can aptly select their desired instrument based on location, price and other factors using search filters. They can then message and even rate the lender whose instument has been selected. Implementing Google Maps API allows the users to glance at the type of instruments available at a particular location on a map. The initial web version of this app focused on HTML & JavaScript. Later versions used Java and remote engineering, along with Gradle build in Android Studio 10.

Special attention was given to the **User Interface Design** of this app along with making sure that the consistency, aesthetics, colors, usability, learnability, and safety of the app are optimum. Fitts' law, Nielsen’s 10 heuristics and Norman’s seven stages of action (i.e., gulfs of execution and evaluation) helped with the User Experience of the app as well.
